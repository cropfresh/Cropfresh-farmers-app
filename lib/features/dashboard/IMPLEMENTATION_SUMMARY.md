- ‚úÖ `MarketPrice` - Crop pricing and trend models with calculations
- ‚úÖ `NotificationData` - System notifications with priority levels
- ‚úÖ `QuickAction` - Quick action definitions for dashboard
- ‚úÖ `DashboardState` - Complete state management model

### 3. Business Logic Layer
- ‚úÖ `DashboardController` - Riverpod StateNotifier for state management
- ‚úÖ Parallel data loading for optimal performance
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Offline mode detection and management

### 4. Services Layer
- ‚úÖ `WeatherService` - Weather API integration with mock data
- ‚úÖ `MarketService` - Market price API with trend calculations
- ‚úÖ `NotificationService` - Notification management system
- ‚úÖ Mock data generators for development and testing

### 5. Repository Layer
- ‚úÖ `DashboardRepository` - Data persistence and caching
- ‚úÖ Quick actions configuration management
- ‚úÖ Sync time tracking and cache management
- ‚úÖ Offline data retrieval capabilities

### 6. State Management
- ‚úÖ Riverpod providers for dashboard state
- ‚úÖ Isolated providers for weather, market, and notification data
- ‚úÖ Reactive UI updates based on state changes
- ‚úÖ Loading states for each component

## üé® Dashboard Features Implemented

- Price trend indicators (up/down arrows)
- Percentage change calculations
- Multiple crop support with filtering

### Notifications Panel
- System announcements and alerts
- Order updates and confirmations
- Government scheme notifications
- Priority-based notification display

### Quick Actions Grid

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture Pattern
- Clean Architecture with clear layer separation
- Repository pattern for data access
- Controller pattern for business logic
- SOLID principles compliance

### State Management
- Riverpod StateNotifier for reactive state
- Provider pattern for dependency injection
- Immutable state objects with copyWith methods
- Error boundary implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel data loading (weather + market + notifications)
- Lazy loading for non-critical data
- Memory-efficient list rendering
- Proper disposal of resources

### Error Handling
- Granular error states for each widget
- Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios
- User-friendly error messages

## üì± Usage Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Initialize Dashboard
```dart
// In your app's main navigation
DashboardScreenV2(userProfile: currentUserProfile)
```

### 3. Riverpod Setup
```dart
// Wrap your app with ProviderScope
ProviderScope(
  child: MaterialApp(
    home: DashboardScreenV2(userProfile: userProfile),
  ),
)
```

### 4. Access Dashboard State
```dart
// In any widget
final dashboardState = ref.watch(dashboardControllerProvider);
final weather = ref.watch(weatherDataProvider);
final marketData = ref.watch(marketDataProvider);
```

## üîß Configuration

### API Integration Points
- Weather API endpoint configuration in `WeatherService`
- Market data API setup in `MarketService`
- Notification API integration in `NotificationService`

### Customization Options
- Quick actions can be configured via `DashboardRepository`
- Weather refresh intervals in service configuration
- Market price update frequency settings
- Notification priority levels and types

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Required
- Dashboard controller state management
