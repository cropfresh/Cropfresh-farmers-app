```dart
// 🧪 Unit Test Example (AAA Pattern)
void main() {
  group('CropHealthCalculator', () {
    late CropHealthCalculator calculator;
    
    setUp(() {
      // * ARRANGE: Set up test dependencies
      calculator = CropHealthCalculator();
    });
    
    testWidgets('should calculate crop health correctly', (tester) async {
      // * ARRANGE: Prepare test data
      final inputCropData = CropData(
        soilMoisture: 65.0,
        temperature: 25.0,
        humidity: 70.0,
      );
      const expectedHealthScore = 85.0;
      
      // * ACT: Execute the function under test
      final actualHealthScore = calculator.calculateHealth(inputCropData);
      
      // * ASSERT: Verify the results
      expect(actualHealthScore, equals(expectedHealthScore));
    });
  });
}
```

## 📖 Development Guidelines

### 🎯 Code Quality Standards

#### Better Comments Usage
```dart
// * MAIN CROP MONITORING FEATURE
// ! SECURITY: This handles sensitive farmer data
class CropMonitoringService {
  
  // ? TODO: Implement ML-based disease detection
  Future<CropHealth> analyzeCropHealth(String imageUrl) async {
    // NOTE: Using TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference
    // OPTIMIZE: Consider caching model predictions
    
    try {
      // * Process the crop image for analysis
      final processedImage = await _preprocessImage(imageUrl);
      
      // ! ALERT: Ensure image validation before processing
      if (processedImage == null) {
        // FIXME: Implement proper error handling
        throw Exception('Invalid image data');
      }
      
      return await _runInference(processedImage);
    } catch (error) {
      // HACK: Temporary fallback to manual analysis
      return _getFallbackAnalysis();
    }
  }
}
```

#### Function Standards
```dart
// * USER AUTHENTICATION HANDLER
// SECURITY: Handles sensitive authentication data
Future<AuthResult> authenticateUser({  
  required String email,
  required String password,
  bool rememberMe = false,
}) async {
  // ! IMPORTANT: Input validation is critical for security
  _validateUserInput(email, password);
  
  try {
    // * Authenticate with backend service
    final authResponse = await _authService.signIn(email, password);
    
    // * Store authentication tokens securely
    if (rememberMe) {
      await _secureStorage.storeTokens(authResponse.tokens);
    }
    
    return AuthResult.success(user: authResponse.user);
  } on NetworkException catch (error) {
    // NOTE: Network errors should be handled gracefully
    return AuthResult.failure(message: 'Network connection failed');
  } catch (error) {
    // FIXME: Implement specific error handling for different auth failures
    return AuthResult.failure(message: 'Authentication failed');
  }
}
```

### 📁 File Organization
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file should have one primary purpose
- **Maximum 750 lines**: Split larger files into logical modules
- **Feature-based grouping**: Organize by business domain, not technical layers

### 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines
- **Material 3 Components**: Use official Material 3 widgets
- **60-30-10 Color Rule**: Follow the defined color system
- **Accessibility First**: Implement semantic labels and high contrast
- **Responsive Design**: Support multiple screen sizes and orientations
