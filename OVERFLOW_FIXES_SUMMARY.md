# Overflow Issues Fixed - CropFresh Farmers App

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Land Details Screen - Acres/Hectares Selection Overflow

**Problem**: The segmented button for selecting acres or hectares was overflowing on smaller screens due to being placed in a horizontal Row with fixed width constraints.

**Location**: `lib/features/registration/farm_details/widgets/land_details_step.dart`

**Solution**:
- Changed the layout from a horizontal `Row` to a vertical `Column` structure
- Moved the land area input field to be full-width at the top
- Placed the acres/hectares selection buttons below the input field
- Made the `SegmentedButton` full-width with proper sizing constraints
- Added appropriate spacing between elements

**Code Changes**:
```dart
// Before: Row with Expanded widgets causing overflow
Row(
  children: [
    Expanded(flex: 2, child: TextFormField(...)),
    SizedBox(width: 12),
    Expanded(child: SegmentedButton(...)),
  ],
)

// After: Column with full-width elements
Column(
  children: [
    TextFormField(...), // Full width
    SizedBox(height: 16),
    SizedBox(
      width: double.infinity,
      child: SegmentedButton(...), // Full width with proper sizing
    ),
  ],
)
```

### 2. Registration Complete Screen - Farm Profile Overflow

**Problem**: The success view was using a centered Column without scroll capability, causing overflow on smaller screens or when content was too long.

**Location**: `lib/features/registration/farm_details/widgets/success_view.dart`

**Solution**:
- Wrapped the content in `SafeArea` for proper screen boundaries
- Added `SingleChildScrollView` to enable scrolling when content overflows
- Changed from `MainAxisAlignment.center` to `CrossAxisAlignment.center` for better layout
- Added text overflow handling with `TextOverflow.visible` and `softWrap: true`
- Improved the `_buildSummaryRow` widget to handle long text values properly
- Added proper spacing and padding for better visual hierarchy

**Code Changes**:
```dart
// Before: Fixed height Column with center alignment
Padding(
  child: Column(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: [...],
  ),
)

// After: Scrollable content with proper overflow handling
SafeArea(
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    child: Column(
      crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [...],
    ),
  ),
)
```

**Enhanced Summary Row**:
- Added `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start` for better alignment
- Implemented `TextOverflow.visible` and `softWrap: true` for long text
- Added spacing for better visual separation

## Benefits

1. **Responsive Design**: Both screens now adapt properly to different screen sizes
2. **Better UX**: Users can scroll through content that doesn't fit on screen
3. **Accessibility**: Improved text handling for users with larger font sizes
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure with proper widget organization
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test on various screen sizes (small phones, tablets, different orientations)
2. Test with different system font sizes (accessibility settings)
3. Test with long text values in farm profile details
4. Verify the acres/hectares selection works properly on all devices

## Technical Details
